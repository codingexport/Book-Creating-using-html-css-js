        <p>Dear Crush ❤️, this is for you 🤞💖</p>
        <p>
          Hi, I am Akhilesh Nishad. Thank you for opening this book. It means a lot.
          Seeing you here makes my heart smile. 💖

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Before you dive into these pages, take a deep breath, press play on the video, and let the words unfold like a story whispered straight from my heart. ❤️</p>
        <p>
          This book isn’t just ink on paper—it’s a reflection of moments, emotions, and unspoken words. Each page is a journey, a piece of me, waiting for you to discover.  
        </p>
        <p>So, turn the page, and let’s travel through memories together. 🤞💖</p>
        <br /><br /><br />
        <p>Please turn the page...</p>

        <p>
          I come from a small village, a boy with dreams too big for his world. 🌎
          My parents always supported me, but somewhere along the way, I became too comfortable. Procrastination became my worst enemy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every time I tried to rise, life threw challenges at me. I met people who made me feel special, only to leave me behind when I got attached. 💔
          Love found me, but it never stayed.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, I search for a job, for purpose, for meaning. But deep inside, I know—
          it was my own fears that held me back. My own hands crushed my dreams.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, all that remains are regrets and a longing to turn back time... ⏳
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="page text-page" onclick="movePage(this, 4)">
        <p>
          But life isn't about regrets, right? It’s about moving forward, about rewriting the story before the last page is turned.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you've come this far, then maybe... just maybe, you see something in me that I forgot to see in myself. Hope. 💫
        </p>
        <p>
          I don’t know what the future holds, but I do know one thing—
          I won’t let my story end like this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Will you stay till the last page? Will you be a part of my story?
